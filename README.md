# ðŸš€ Shuttle: The Future of Interplanetary Travel ðŸŒŒ

Welcome to Shuttle! The future has arrived, and with it comes the unprecedented ability to travel between planets at lightning speed. Imagine booking a trip to Mars or Venus as easily as ordering a taxi. With Shuttle, this is now a reality! Our innovative application, built on a robust Spring Boot microservices architecture, is designed to make your interplanetary journeys smooth, safe, and incredibly fast.

## Project Overview

Shuttle is powered by a suite of microservices, each responsible for a critical aspect of the operation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of our microservices and their functionalities:

### Microservices Architecture

1. **ADMIN-SERVICE**
   - **Functionality:** Manages administrative tasks, including user and pilot management, system configurations, and operational monitoring.
   - **Tech Stack:** It will be determined as it is developed

2. **PILOT-SERVICE**
   - **Functionality:** Handles pilot operations, including assigning pilots to trips, managing pilot schedules, and maintaining pilot records.
   - **Tech Stack:** It will be determined as it is developed

3. **FLEET-MANAGEMENT-SERVICE**
   - **Functionality:** Oversees the fleet of spacecraft, ensuring maintenance, availability, and optimal utilization of all vessels.
   - **Tech Stack:** It will be determined as it is developed

4. **NOTIFICATION-SERVICE**
   - **Functionality:** Sends important notifications to users and pilots regarding trip updates, schedule changes, and critical alerts.
   - **Tech Stack:** It will be determined as it is developed

5. **PAYMENT-SERVICE**
   - **Functionality:** Processes payments for interplanetary travel, manages transactions, and handles refunds.
   - **Tech Stack:** It will be determined as it is developed

6. **RATING-SERVICE**
   - **Functionality:** Collects and manages user and pilot ratings to ensure quality service and user satisfaction.
   - **Tech Stack:** It will be determined as it is developed

7. **TRIP-MANAGEMENT-SERVICE**
   - **Functionality:** Manages all aspects of the trip, from planning and scheduling to real-time tracking and trip status updates.
   - **Tech Stack:** It will be determined as it is developed

8. **USER-SERVICE**
   - **Functionality:** Manages user information, including registration, profile updates, and authentication.
   - **Tech Stack:** It will be determined as it is developed

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Securely register and log in to your account to access all Shuttle services.
- **Pilot Management:** Assign and manage pilots for each trip, ensuring that only the best are at the helm.
- **Fleet Management:** Keep track of all spacecraft, ensuring they are ready and available for each journey.
- **Trip Planning and Booking:** Easily plan, book, and manage your trips across planets with just a few clicks.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Stay informed with real-time notifications about your trip status, schedule changes, and more.
- **Ratings and Reviews:** Rate your experiences and read reviews to choose the best pilots and services.
- **Secure Payments:** Make secure payments for your trips and manage your transactions effortlessly.

## Technology Stack

Our microservices are built using **Spring Boot** to ensure a scalable and maintainable architecture. We use **Spring Cloud** for distributed system patterns such as configuration management, service discovery, and circuit breakers, powered by **Eureka Server** for service registration and discovery. For asynchronous messaging and real-time data streaming, we utilize **Kafka**. Each service is designed to be independent, allowing for flexible development and deployment.

## Unique features and considerations that have been introduced or will be introduced into this project

- **Realistic Planetary Positioning:** The path calculation considers the approximate real positions of the planets.
- **Collision Avoidance:** Paths are calculated to avoid collisions with other planets and to stay clear of their gravitational zones.
- **Real-Time Shuttle Tracking:** The frontend displays real-time movement of all shuttles.
- **Emergency Response:** The system accounts for shuttle breakdowns, triggering rescue missions for evacuation.
- **Business Metrics:** Profits, costs, and other business statistics are tracked, albeit in a simplified form.
- **Dynamic Load Simulation:** The system simulates dynamic loads, monitored through Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Prices are dynamically adjusted based on various factors.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** During high load periods, new service instances can be deployed alongside a load balancer to distribute the traffic efficiently.
